# The Zoo

![App Screenshot](https://i.postimg.cc/SR0t75F8/Sk-rmklipp.jpg)

A Single Page Application (SPA) built using React with TypeScript. It simulates a zoo and allows users to interact with the animals by feeding them.

The application fetches the list of animals from an external API and stores the data locally. Users can mark animals as fed, and the application tracks the time of feeding.

For advanced functionality, the feeding status resets automatically after three hours. A notification system alerts users when an animal hasn't been fed for four hours.
